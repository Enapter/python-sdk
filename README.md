## Writing your own UCM

### Sending telemetry and properties
You should define method with `task_` prefix to do periodic job. Typically telemetry sends every 1 seconds and properties every 10 seconds. So, the simplest way to implement this â€” define two task methods. Refer to wttr-in example for working sorce code.

### Handle commands
You should define method with name `cmd_<command_name_in_manfiest>` with defined arguments. The zhimi-fan-za5 example has a different types of command.

### Sending alerts
The alerts are stored in `self.alerts` set object. They should be updated before every `send_telemetry` call, because alerts are sending with telemetry.
